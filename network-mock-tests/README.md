The purpose of this module is to validate that the TLA mocks (CDB and Bearcat) used by the
PublisherSDK act like the PreProd of each TLA.

FIXME: Before open sourcing the PubSDK and running tests on public CI, this module should be
extracted in another project and kept internal in order to access the preprod of the TLA.
