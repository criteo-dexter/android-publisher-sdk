The purpose of this module is to validate that the TLA mocks (CDB and Bearcat) used by the
PublisherSDK act like the PreProd of each TLA.

TODO EE-1168: Periodically trigger tests
Those tests should be run periodically and act as a watchdog notifying us in case of behavior
changes between the mocks and the TLA.
